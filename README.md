# Sparcle: Boosting the Accuracy of Data Cleaning Systems through Spatial Awareness

This is an implementation of Sparcle ideas in side Baran system (Raha 1.25). 

The implementation is in branch "sparcle", in file raha/correction.py: https://github.com/yhuang-db/baran-sparcle/blob/sparcle/raha/correction.py#

The best way to understand the implementation is to compare the sparcle-version (branch sparcle) with the original version (branch main): https://github.com/yhuang-db/baran-sparcle/compare/main...sparcle#diff-14b16ec8041e13629779f3d87c33456f6ea0742e1258545658da80992c3c34c0R210
